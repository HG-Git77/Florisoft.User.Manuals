# **Florisoft manual Commissionair**

##  Preface

Welcome to the Florisoft Commissionair manual for the PDA. This guide is
designed to teach the users how to use the Commissionair module on a PDA.
After reading the guide, the user is able to successfully use the Commissionair module.

This module is used when data from parties has to be exchanged between
customer and the commission agent using EKT-messages. Using the module,
it makes it possible to import and export sold/bought products in
different systems.

If the user experiences any difficulties with the Commissionair module at
any time, or if the current manual does not cover the desired
functionalities, please contact support.


## 1 Sending invoice parties via EKT

This chapter describes the steps needed to be able to send discounts
using the Florisoft application. Doing this will require the Commission
module. This module enables the user to send sold parties to the
customer system. To use the module, follow the steps below.

First, open up the Constants Community Debtors and select a debtor.

Double click the selected debtor to open up the properties. Select “EKT”
to open up the setting regarding the EKT messages. Now there are 3
parameters that have to be set in order for the Commission module to
work.

First, enter the e-mail address(no.1) on which the customer will be
receiving the EKT messages.

Second, enter an auction code (no.2). This auction code must be
coordinated with the customer and is intended to distinguish the
different auctions from each other in the EKT message.

Third, you can select “Send deliveries through email” (no.3). This
setting ensures that the debtor is e-mailed when EKT-messages are sent
automatically via the timer.

##### **!!The setting “send deliveries through email” should only be checked while automatically sending EKT-messages via the timer (see chapter 4) !!**

## 2 Manually send selected parties via EKT

You can also manually send EKT-messages using “Invoices”.

Select “Invoices” in the Navigator double click the relevant invoice. The
“Modify Invoice” screen will show.

message will appear with confirmation of the amount of messages send.

## 3 Invoice shipping options from invoice summary

In addition to manually sending items on an invoice, Florisoft also
offers a number of possibilities to send items with specific properties.
These properties are as follows:

-   Send New transactions: send all transactions (items) which have been added to the invoice after the last shipment.

-   Send all transactions today: send all transactions (items) that ended up on the invoice today.

-   Send all transaction Invoice: send all transactions (all items) on the invoice.

These settings can be found in “Maintenance Invoices” -> “Internet”.

Also for these three options, the invoice gets a brown background color.

In addition to the manual option to send EKT-messages, Florisoft also
offers the possibility to automatically send messages using a timer.
