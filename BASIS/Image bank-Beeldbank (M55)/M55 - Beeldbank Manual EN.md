# Florisoft manual Image library

Welcome to the Florisoft Imagebank manual for desktop. This guide is
designed to teach the users how to use the Image library module. After
reading the guide, the user is able to successfully use the Photolibrary
module.

When you buy on the KLOK, you will get a number (PHOTOID).
With the Image library you will be able to download specific photo's using the
PHOTOID. When downloading photo's, Florisoft will scale them to 4 formats.

## Setting up
In order to start using the Image library module, a few settings have to be adjusted.

Start by starting up the Florisoft application and accessing the Constants -> Community -> Image library.
