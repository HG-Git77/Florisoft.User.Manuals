## Introduction

Welcome to the manual for logging into Florisoft. The Florisoft application is usually running on a cloud server. That is why logging in consists out of 2 steps: logging onto the cloud server and logging onto Florisoft. These two steps are explained in the next 2 chapters.

After this introduction a chapter will follow explaining logging into the cloud server. Only autorised users can access the server. These users received a username and password during the implementation process of Florisoft.

Chapter 3 describes the process of logging into Florisoft. Here the same principles apply as it does for logging into the cloud server: only autorised users can access Florisoft using a username and password.

In chapter 4 is is described how a user can log into the webshop. These steps in the chapter are optional. Not every customer uses a webshop. The webshop has different types accounts that can log in, though the logging in process is the same for all.

The goal of this manual is to explain to Florisoft users how to log into the server, aswell as Florisoft.

## Logging into the server

To be able to log into the cloud server, we will use the Microsoft RDP-protocol. This allows us to use a computer from a distance. Below is the process of logging in described.

1.  Click on the the magnifying glass or searchbar on the Windows taskbar.

> As your pc might be set to English, make sure the is called "Remote Desktop Connection".

3.  Click on "Remote Desktop connection".

A window "Remote Desktop Connection" will appear.

4. In the "Computer:" field, enter the name of the cloud server. This name is provided by Florisoft during the implementation.

6.  Now a window will pop-up, asking you to fill in a username and password of the cloud server. These were also provide by Florisoft during the implementation process.

7.  Click on OK to continue.

> With a working wifi-connection Windows will now connect to the cloud server.

## Logging into the server (RESET)

If you are hosted on a RESET (Hosting service) server you have a sligthly different log in process. To log into your server using Microsoft's RDP service follow the steps listed below.

0. For the following steps a .RDP file is required, if you are hosted on RESET servers Florisoft will have provided this for you. In case you don't have the RDP file needed to connect to the server, contact Florisoft.

1. Find the .RDP file on your desktop (most likely) and double left click on it. This should open a RDP screen.

3. By pressing connect a new Windows Security screen should appear were you need to authenticate using the provided user credentials. Fill in the right username and password, if there is already a user selected (that you don't want to log into) click on more choices and then use different account this should allow you to enter the credentials of a different user.

    Click on **OK** to finalize the log in process, you should soon be able to see the server's desktop screen.
