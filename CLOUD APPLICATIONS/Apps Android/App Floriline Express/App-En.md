# Florisoft Floriline App

Welcome to the manual for using the Floriline app on Android. This manual explains the standard procedure for the Floriline app, which will mainly be used by line drivers.

## Logging In

When you start the app, you will enter the login screen. Here, you log in using the system user that is set in the Floriline Management screen.

If only one trip is configured, the PDA will immediately start synchronization and load all data onto the device.  
If multiple trips are configured, you will get a selection screen where you can choose which trip you want to select.

When printing the invoice, you can add a surcharge to the invoice or charge transport costs. The surcharge is by default set to the discount costs from the Floriline Management screen.

After creating the invoice, it must be synchronized. At the top left there is a cloud icon; the number shown indicates how many invoices still need to be synchronized.

If there is no connection, a line will be shown through the cloud. As soon as there is a connection again, the invoices will be synchronized.

This process can be repeated for each trip.
