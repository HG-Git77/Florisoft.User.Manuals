# Florisoft Inventory App Manual

This manual describes the use and configuration of the Florisoft Inventory App. With this app, you can manage your stock and keep it synchronized with the actual stock locations in your warehouse.

The app consists of three distinct modules:

## Stockcounting

With the Stockcounting app, you inspect stock parcels and ensure they remain synchronized with the data in Florisoft backoffice.

## Price Label

The Price Label app allows users to easily print price labels by scanning a division label (pick order label). These labels can be immediately assigned as an extra service to the receiving customer and product.
