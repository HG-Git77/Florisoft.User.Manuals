### Step 4: Scan or Search for a Parcel

Open the stock counting functionality in the Inventory App. You can scan a parcel

<details><summary><b>Click here for an example!</b></summary><img src="Media/Doorloop/4B.png"></details>

or search by:

<details><summary><b>Click here for an example!</b></summary><img src="Media/Doorloop/5.png"></details>

* Article name
* Parcel number
* Vparcel number
* Scancode
* Scancode2

Only parcels in configured stock locations will be shown.

### Step 5: Select a Parcel

Click **Select stock item** to open the parcel detail. If the parcel was selected via scanning, this screen will open automatically.

### Step 6: Review and Adjust Values

Adjust the stock values as needed in the stock item detail screen. If a parcel was previously inspected, an orange banner will appear at the top of the screen. If there are open pick orders for the parcel, this will also be indicated. Note that the displayed total includes quantities still to be picked.

### Step 7: Confirm Stock and Continue

Click the green button to save the updated stock. A confirmation will appear. You can then proceed to inspect the next parcel, either manually or by scanning directly. If a change was made and the user scans the next item immediately, a confirmation prompt with the change will be displayed. This prompt must be confirmed before continuing.

After inspection, the corresponding stock line will be highlighted in green and filled with the inspection date and time, the user who performed the inspection, and the associated seller.

Click a stock line to open the division screen and review the recorded divisions.

### Step 9: Repeat for all parcels

Repeat the above steps for all stock parcels.

### Step 10: Finalize Inspection

At the end of the inspection, it is clear whether all stock lines have been checked. Lines not marked as inspected must still be processed. Once all lines are properly inspected, the view can be reset to start fresh during the next inspection:

**Options → Stock Inspection → Reset**
