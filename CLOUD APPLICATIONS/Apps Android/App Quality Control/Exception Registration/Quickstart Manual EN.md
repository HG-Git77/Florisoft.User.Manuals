# Florisoft Quality Control App – Exception Registration Guide

## Introduction

This guide describes how to use the Exception Registration feature in the Florisoft Quality Control App.  
The app workflow is configured based on the relevant policies.

This module allows users to quickly and accurately register deviations during operational processes such as order picking or final check.

> ℹ️ A full guide on configuring these policies is available at: [Policies Exception Registration EN](https://github.com/florisoft/User.Manuals/blob/main/CLOUD%20APPLICATIONS/Apps%20Android/App%20Quality%20Control/Exception%20Registration/Policies%20Exception%20Registration%20EN.md)

**Requirements:**

- Florisoft Quality Control App
- License for Exception Registration
- Backoffice module: Division Control

## Exception Registration Procedure

### When should you register an exception?

Register an exception in cases of damage, incorrect delivery, or any other deviation to ensure proper administrative handling and follow-up processes.

> ℹ️ Note: When Exception Registration is automatically triggered from another Florisoft app (such as Picking or Final Outbound Check), steps 1 through 3 are skipped. You are taken directly to the scan or registration screen.

### Step 1: Log in to the Quality Control App

Open the app from the Florisoft Hub App or via the standalone Quality Control app icon. Log in with your user credentials.

- Trolley barcode  
- Cvar15

### Step 4: Register an exception

After scanning a valid barcode, the registration form appears. Follow these steps:

1. **Select the reason**  
   The available reasons are retrieved automatically.  
   Some reasons require a photo. In that case, the button shows “Picture”; otherwise, “Picture (Optional)”.

2. **Enter the quantity**  
   By default, the remaining quantity is suggested.  
   The value must be greater than zero and cannot exceed the remaining quantity.

3. **Optionally, add a photo and comment**

4. **Confirm the registration**  
   Tap the checkmark to confirm. If successful, the message **“Exception submitted”** will appear.  
   The remaining quantity is adjusted immediately.

> ℹ️ All registered exceptions are also automatically stored in the parcel log, including details such as reason and user.

### Step 5: Backoffice Overview

- Go to: **Division Control**

  > ℹ️ If **Division Control** is not visible in the navigation menu, it can be added via design mode (F12).

- You will see an overview of all registered exceptions, including debtor, article number, description, reason, and comments.

- Attached photos are visible via right-click or by pressing **F5**. If multiple photos are attached, use the context menu to browse them.
