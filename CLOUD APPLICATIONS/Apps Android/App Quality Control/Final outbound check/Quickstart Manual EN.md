<br>

> ℹ️ If the Quality Control App has not yet been installed, download it via the Florisoft Hub-App. Refer to the installation guide: [Hub-App Installation EN](https://github.com/florisoft/User.Manuals/blob/main/CLOUD%20APPLICATIONS/App%20Hub/Hub-App%20Installation%20EN.md)

### Step 2: Select Order

To begin checking an order, first select an open customer order. This can be done in two ways:

#### Option 1: Scan a barcode

Scan the barcode of an order line, for example, a pickorder sticker. The correct barcode setting must be enabled via the policy `BarcodeDecodeOptions`.

#### Option 2: Search order via search icon

Use the search icon to display an overview of available customer orders. This overview can be customized according to your preference. The necessary policies for this are located in the `Overview` subfolder of the FinalOutbound policies.

### Step 3: Check Order Lines

After selecting a customer order, the **To check** page will open. This page displays all order lines that still need to be checked. Each order line can be checked by scanning the corresponding barcode. During scanning, the system automatically validates:

* whether the barcode is recognized,
* whether the item belongs to the selected order,
* and whether the line has already been fully checked.

<details><summary><b>Click here for an example!</b></summary><img src="Media/Doorloop/4.png"></details>
<br>
The way in which a check is handled depends on the setting of the `CountingStrategy` policy. This determines whether the checked number is derived from:

* the quantity in the barcode,
* the number of packages (kolli),
* or the entire ordered quantity.

If scanning an order line is not possible, the check can also be performed manually. This manual check is visually displayed on the screen and recorded in the parcel log.

<br>

If there is a problem with an order line and the line is configured as an add-on (see relevant policy), an exception can be recorded through exception registration. This will also be visually shown to the user.

<br>

It is also possible to approve an entire order at once. This functionality depends on the `AllowCompleteEntireTarget` policy.

### Step 4: Complete the Order

When all lines are checked, the orders will receive the status Checked.

<br>
Various statuses are also updated in the back office—invoices, such as the check mark for the final check, the final scan performed by the seller, and the final check number.

There are also additional options:

* A single order line can be released again for checking via the policy `AllowResetOrderItem`.
* The entire order can be restarted via the policy `AllowResetEntireTarget`.

By clicking Next, any follow-up steps can be performed, such as taking photos.

<br>

<br>
The `ShowWarningIfIncomplete` policy checks whether all parcel have been checked. If not, a warning appears.
