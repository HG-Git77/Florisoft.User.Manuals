# Florisoft Quality Control App Manual

This manual describes the use and configuration of the Florisoft Quality Control App. This app supports quality checks during logistics processes, such as registering exceptions or performing a final outbound check.

The app consists of two distinct modules:

## Exception Registration

With the Exception Registration app, employees can easily register exceptions that occur during operational processes, such as order picking. The app is focused on distributed parcels and supports capturing issues such as damage, missing quantities, or quality concerns.

Registrations can include photos, comments, quantities, and a reason. The app can be used as a standalone module or integrated into other Florisoft apps. Processing of exceptions takes place in a follow-up app: Exception Handling.

## Final Outbound Check *(coming soon)*

The Final Outbound Check is a final quality control step before shipment. This module will be added to this manual at a later stage.
