# Introduction

The active e-mail module is a commonly used module within the Florisoft software package. This module falls under the overarching Florishop sales module. Previous iterations of this module had a accessibility problem since it needed to be created in a HTML format. This also caused a lot more work in testing functionality and design. <br>

Because of this a new editor was developed, the editor will change but more importantly simplify the process of creating e-mail layouts. For now the editor will only be accessible to Florisoft employees but in the future the editor will be accessible for you as well. <br>

The intention of this manual to get to know the editors functionality and learn how to create e-mail lay-outs for your business. We will start with the basiscs of getting to the editing screen first, if you are already familiar with those steps skip ahead to [step 4](#step-4-the-editor). <br>

**Note:** *The editor is still partially in developmen meaning that some functionalities might be subject to change. This document will be updated as soon as possible but might lag behind.*  

# Step 1. Getting to the mailing configuration screen 
Go the your florishop webpage and login with a management account. Once logged in go to:</br> *configuration* **â†’**  *mail configuration* as shown in the image below.

A dialog screen should a appear with options for our new template (example seen below). The following options should be set for our new template:  

1. **Theme filter** : Select the theme filter **TODO**!
2. **Mail type filter**: with this drop down selector you can set the type of template you are going to create.  This is an important field to get right as only some filter types will work with backoffice functionalities such as offers.
3. **Template name** : in this field you can set the name of the new template. For the purpose of this manual we will set the name to '*ExampleOfferTemplateEN*'.
