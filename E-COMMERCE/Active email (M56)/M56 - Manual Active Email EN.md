# **Active Email**

For this add-on module the module Special Offers is required.

In order to send an Active E-mail first [create a special offer in Florisoft](https://github.com/florisoft/User.Manuals/tree/main/BASIS/Special%20Offers-Aanbiedingslijsten%20(M33))

Then you can use the example button to show an example of the offer on screen. For that you must first select which layout you want to use. If you're satisfied, you can use the email webpage button to send the offer. This uses the data set in the debtor.

You can also set a standard layout per debtor. Use the checkbox 'Debtor set layout has priority' in the layout choice when sending.

When an offer is active for a customer, he will also see a separate offers tab on the webshop.

If you want to send this offer via Whatsapp, you can click 'right' on the offer and copy the offer url. You can paste this URL into Whatsapp web and send it this way.

It is possible that you receive the message below when copying the URL. In this case you must enter your FloriShop URL in the debtor data, as in the example below.

We have now created an offer for 1 customer, but want to use this offer for other customers as well. For this, we first select the already created special offer and press the copy button, this opens the well-known selection screen where we can select the other debtors/debtor groups, etc.
