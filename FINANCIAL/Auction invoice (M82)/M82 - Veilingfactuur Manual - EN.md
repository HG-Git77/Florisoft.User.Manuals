# Florisoft Manual Auction Invoice

Welcome to the manual for the module Auction invoice. The module Florisoft .Net Auction Invoice is created to process auction invoices in the system. In this manual the module will be explained and it will be shown how to use the module.

*This module is for both Auction Invoice and Auction connect Invoice.*

## XML-file of the invoice
In order to use the module properly, you will need to tell the auction you want to receive the auction invoice in .xml also.
Once you have received the .xml file, store it on your computer (don't make it too difficult to find), open Florisoft and right click on History.

Select "Veilingfactuur verwerken" or "Connect factuur inlezen" (based on which you would like to do).
Here you will have to select the .xml file from your computer in order for it to be read by Florisoft.

*For both Veilingfactuur and Veiling connect factuur the steps below are the same.*

Here you will have to fill in 2 fields, the invoicenr. and the total goods amount. Usually you will have a paper copy near, if not, the file name of the .xml should be the invoicenr. 

If you have the invoice as a .pdf, it is ofcourse easier and smarter to look there for the total goods amount.

But you can also find the total goods amount in the .xml file. When opening the .xml file, you'll have to search for the total goods amount. This will be between 2 of </feram:ActualBillingMonetarySummation>, see image below. In this case the total goods amount is 360.900 .
