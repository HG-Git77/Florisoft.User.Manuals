# Florisoft DIS manual

Welcome to the Florisoft Debtor Information System (DIS) manual. In order to create an insight into a specific customer, you can assign a file to a customer using the DIS module. Within the module, you can add documents and create an overview of all appointments made with a customer, for example appointments concerning shipments or payment.

If you also use the module Florisoft . Net Aanmaningen (Payment Reminder), the created files will be processed in here. In addition, this module provides extensive insight into the open items and the customer's payment behavior in overviews and graphs, and you can see what a customer has generated in turnover per year. The clarity of the contact information and the possibility to quickly complete and consult the file enables you to speak to a customer by telephone and at the same time update your file.

The Florisoft .Net Scheduling module is fully integrated in this module.

# Using the module
To start using the module, simply start up the Florisoft application and click on Debtor IS.

The screen which will pop up contains an overview of all agreements made. The goal of DIS is to save agreements, like quotations, when they have been made. Even when the agreement was carried out orally.

As seen below, 2 parties have made several agreements.

If you are just starting with the DIS module, this won't be the view you see. It will probably be empty, like the picture below.

There are a few point of interest in this picture.

1. First, at the top of the screen the debtor information is shown. If you'd like add rows(agreements), you first have to select the debtor for whom you wish to add the row. Once added, the information of the debtor, like the name, place and email will appear.

2. After selecting the debtor, you can start adding rows to the debtor. As shown on the picture, there are a multitide of rows you can add. To add a row to a debtor, simply click on the kind of row you wish to add. A row will be made on the screen, which you can now fill. See nr. 4 to see what has to be filled.

3. After a while of using DIS, the rows you have added will figuratively overvlow your screen. Then finding specific rows can be hard. You can use the filtering options to make your search easier. As the photo show, you can filter on the kind of rows the debtor has and on the date.

4. After adding a row to a debtor, it will be empty. This will then have to be filled with a little information to know what agreement have been made. First, a status can be assigned. Newly made rows will automatically have the "Active" status, but after a row/agreement has been fulfilled you can put the status on "Inactive".

    Secondly is the Type of row. These are the kind of rows you can make, the choices you have are shown at nr.2.

    When there are certain rows which have to be found fast for whatever reason, you can select the "Sticky" option. This will move the row to the top of the screen so it can be found easily.

    When certain files, like photo's or emails, are relevant to the row made you can add them to the row by uploading them to the Attachments. This way you can easily find where the row/agreement has come from.

    Also, there is a big white open field on the bottom right of the screen. Here you can add a description to the row. This can be a description of how the agreements took placce, how the interaction went etc.

5. Lastly, there a different views on the rows that DIS can provide:

"Open posts" gives an oversight of all open standing payments of the debtor.

"Turnover" shows the turnover the debtor has done per year.

The last view, is "Documents". This shows an overview of all attachments.
