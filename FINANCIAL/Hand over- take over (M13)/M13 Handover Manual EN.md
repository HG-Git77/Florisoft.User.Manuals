## 1 Adjusting the settings

In order to correctly use the Handover module, there are a few settings
that will need to be adjusted/confirmed before the handover of items.

First, log into Florisoft and access the Constants -> Locations -> Auctions.

Enter your own buyer number per auction where you will be handing over items to.

Press OK to continue.

Now switch over to the debtors (Constants -> Community -> Debtors) and double
click on a debtor to handover. Then head to Invoice -> Invoice. Fill in the
appropriate information. At “Auction”, fill in the auction where you
handover the debtor to.

To check if this has been done correctly, go back to the Navigator and
access the Invoices. If the relevant invoice shows and “O” under “disk”,
it is ready to be handed over.

After passing the invoice to the history you can see the invoice in the
handover tab. This screen is opened from the Navigator via the
“Handover” button.

Select the invoice you wish to handover.
First, check if the correct auctions and date has been selected.

If those settings are correct, you can click "Send" on the bottom right of the screen.

You can handover once per day. When someting is not right (for any reason) you can handover
the invoice again the day after the original handover by pressing "Opnieuw Overgeven" or "Handover Again".
Using the option, the selected invoice will be put on the current day so you can hand it over again.
