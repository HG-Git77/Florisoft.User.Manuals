## 1. Introduction
This manual describes the debtor management part from Florisoft, informally also called the (Debtors) Open Posts screen.


## 2. General process flow
The first important thing to understand is the way an open post is created in Florisoft. Below a simple diagram shows the different steps Florisoft need to take to create an open post.

<img src="media/2021-06-03-21-11-52.png" />

### Step 1: Make divisions
The first step consists of the creation of divisions of stock parcels. This can be done manually or by customers themselfs via a webshop.

### Step 2: Carry out divisions to invoice
The second step involves carrying out the divisions from te stock to the invoice. This can be done manually (Carry out option or F2 key) 

### Step 3: Print invoice
When an invoice is complete it is printed officialy which means it gets an invoice number. Invoices with an invoicenumber cannot be changed anymore and must be seen as closed. (definitive)

### Step 4: Carry out invoice to invoice history
The last step is carrying out printed invoices to the invoice history. Only invoices which are in the invoice history are visisble in the open posts section. Florisoft sees carried out invoices always as open posts unless one ore more payments are made on those invoices. Possibly made payments can be seen in the Open Posts screen.

## 3. Overview Open Posts section
This chapter describes the most important sections of the Open Posts screen in Florisoft. Click on the Debtors button in the Navigator to open the Open Posts window:
