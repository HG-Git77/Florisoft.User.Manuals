# Implement Florishop Chatfunctie

## Background information

>This document describes the working of the chat function in Florishop. The idea behind this feature is that logged in customers on the webshop can communicate directly with their account manager. (seller) The seller of course has the option to chat 'back' to the customer. In practice, it often happens that customers want more information about a product before they make a purchase. The chat function within the webshop plays an important role in this.

## Prerequisite
The matters below must be arranged/set in advance.

-   Activate Notification center module

## Step 1: Create reserved system user
The first step involves the creation of a new system user that is solely intended to capture chat messages from the webshop into Florisoft. Go via the Navigator to `Constants -> System -> Users -> System users` and create a new system user. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Click the 'Add new item' icon (no. 1) The System Users window opens.
2. Fill in WEBCHAT at the Userid field. (no. 2)
3. Enter a corresponding password at the Password field (no. 3)

## Step 2: Adjust system settings
The two system settings below have to be checked/set.

1. In the Navigator click on the menu Maintenance -> Setup System. (no. 1) The Florisoft.NET System Setup window opens.

<img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/2021-02-12-10-57-15.png).png" />

2. Click on the Advanced tab (no. 2) and enter the password.

<img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/2021-02-12-10-59-50.png).png" />

>**Note: all settings located under the Advanced tab may only be adjusted by Florisoft personnel. That is why those settings are protected by a password.**

3. Set the FIDGETINTERCOMMCHAT setting to True.
4. In the WEBSHOPCHATDESTINATIONUSERID setting, specify the userid of the reserved system user created in Step 1: Create reserved system user.
5. Click Ok to confirm and close the settings in the Florisoft.NET System Setup window.
6. Close Florisoft and restart it.

## Step 3: Adjust webshop settings
The third step describes the settings that are required in the webshop. Follow the steps below to properly configure the appropriate settings:

1. Login to the webshop with the management (ADMIN) account.
2. Open the Management section by clicking on the user's name -> Management. (no. 1)
A menu bar with options will now appear at the top of the webshop.

<img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/2021-02-12-11-16-36.png).png" />

3. Click on the menu Configuration -> Webshop Settings (no. 2) The webshop settings are opened in a separate browser tab.

<img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/2021-02-12-11-18-22.png).png" />

4. In the item field, search for chat (no. 3)
5. Set the SETUP -> WEBCHATAN setting to ON. (no. 4)

<img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/2021-02-12-11-25-24.png).png" />

## Step 4: Create debtor group(s)
Because the chat function is built onto the Sales add-on, it is necessary to divide the debtors who will use the chat function into debtor groups. The idea behind debtor groups is that each salesperson is responsible for contact with an x number of customers. All customers belonging to a salesperson should be grouped in a debtor group.

Below the steps for creating a debtor group are described:

1. Go via the Navigator to `Constants -> Coomunity -> Debtor data -> Debtor groups`.
2. Click the Add new item icon (no. 1) to create a new debtor group.
The new group is automatically assigned a Group code (sequential number, no. 2)
3. Enter a clear description (name) for the group in the Description field (no. 3).
4. Click the Select button (no. 4) and select all debtors that will be grouped in this group.
   All selected debtors are displayed in the Members section: (no. 5)
5. Click Ok (no. 6) to create the new group.

<img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/2021-02-12-11-37-42.png).png" />

## Step 5: Create Webshop sales debtor
Because from a technical point of view, only debtors can log in to the webshop, a separate debtor is needed which is linked to the seller in the next step. The seller will later in turn be linked to the seller's system user. Below is a global step-by-step plan for creating a sales debtor.

A sales debtor is technically seen nothing more than a 'normal' Florisoft debtor. Another name for a sales debtor is: webshop sales debtor.

>**Note: each seller must be linked to its own own sales debtor. One seller therefore also means one sales debtor. Two salespeople also means that there are two sales debtors in the system. In other words: the number of sales debtors must be equal to the number of salespeople.**

1. Go via the Navigator to `Constants -> Community -> Debtor data -> Debtors`.
2. Click on the Add new item icon (no. 1) to create a new debtor. Double click on one of the available debtor templates to base the new sales debtor to be created on. The Debtors window opens.
3. Give the new debtor a Debtor number in the Debtor number field (no. 2)
4. Give the Search field the same or a different value as the debtor number (no. 3)
5. Give the new debtor a clearly defined name in the Company name field (no. 4)
6. In the Country (no. 5) field, select the country of the sales debtor. 
7. Fill in the E-mail address (no. 6) field with the e-mail address of the sales debtor. This e-mail address is usually the same as the address with which the seller communicates to his customers by default.

<img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/2021-02-12-12-11-11.png).png" />

8. Click the ident tab. (no. 7)
