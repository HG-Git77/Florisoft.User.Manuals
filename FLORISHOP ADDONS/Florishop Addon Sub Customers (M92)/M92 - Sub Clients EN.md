# Manual Sub Clients (M92)

The module '*Sub clients*' makes it possible to have 1 main customer that can buy for multiple sub customers on the shop.

## Granting permissions

A logged in debtor can normally only buy for himself, but in FloriShop it is possible to buy for other sub debtors as well when the Sub Clients module is enabled. 

**To do this follow the steps below:**

1. Open the constants screen.

4. Within the Property screen that has popped up navigate to '*Internet*' (#2) **→** '*Internet (#3) Access*'.
5. Click on the button '*Sub client*' (#4) a new popup window should appear. Within this window add the debtors that the main debtor will be able to buy for.


# Buying for sub clients

After sub client(s) were added to the main client, the debtor may buy products for the sub clients from the FloriShop. This may be done in the list view but can also be done per parcel detail view.
