# Preface

The manual describes two ways WhatsApp can be used in relation to the
webshop.

**Pay attention: images in this manual may slightly differ from what you
see on your own screen.**

# Creating an anonymous debtor

An anonymous debtor is required to share stocks/parcels via WhatsApp.
The anonymous debtor is a webshop user who has access to the webshop,
but is limited in terms of possibilities. For example, an anonymous
debtor may not buy. Below is how the creation of an anonymous debtor
works.

**Please note: creating an anonymous debtor is only necessary if it does
not already exist.**
