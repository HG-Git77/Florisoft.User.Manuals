# Preface

Welcome to the FloriShop manual Theme Management. FloriShop has a wide
range of possibilities with regard to the style and design of the
webshop. Through an administrator account it’s possible to customize the
webshop so it fits exactly with the wishes of you and your customers.
This manual explains the most important style options for FloriShop,
supported with illustrations.

The intention is that after, reading this manual you are able to
independently style the webshop according to your own ideas.

After this introduction, chapter two describes the login process on the
web shop as administrator. Only administrator users are able to change
the style of the webshop.

Then in chapter three the operation of the theme management part is
described. The first section of this chapter describes the steps to open
the Theme Configurator. The second part of this chapter describes the
steps to create a new theme.

Chapter four describes the application of the new created theme to the
webshop. This is done via the webshop settings.

Beside colors, type, type size and other settings it is possible to
change pictures. Changing images on the webshop can only be done by
administrator users. Chapter five describes the steps necessary for
changing images on the webshop.

Finally, chapter six describes some extra options available in the Theme
Configurator. These are not necessary for creating a theme, but can be
useful while using the Theme Configurator.

We hope you enjoy working with the webshop in combination with the Theme
Configurator.

**Pay attention: images in this manual may slightly differ from what you
see on your own screen.**

# Logging on as administrator on the webshop

As described in the preface, the theme manager part is not visible for
every webshop user (e.g. regular customers) Therefore you need to log on
with a special administrator account to work with the theme manager.
This administrator account is provided during the implementation of the
webshop.

The following steps describe the log on process for the webshop as an
administrator.

1.  Start a web browser to reach the webshop. It is recommended to use
    > the latest version of Google Chrome.

> <img src=".Manual theme management Florishop\media\image2.png" style="width:0.45833in;height:0.45736in" alt="De bronafbeelding bekijken" />

1.  In the address bar of the browser type or copy paste (Ctrl + C,
    Ctrl + V) the URL of the webshop and press Enter. (no. 1) on your
    keyboard. This’s you regular webshop URL.

> Now there are two options for logging on to the webshop: via the the
> login screen or the home page of the webshop. See the next page for
> more information.

## 2.2 Logging on via the homepage

> Sometimes the webshop shows its products without any customer being
> logged on. Then the logging process into the webshop is a little bit
> different. See below:
>
> <img src=".Manual theme management Florishop\media\image5.png" style="width:6.3in;height:1.16667in" />

> section.
>
> After loggin on to the webshop as administrator, the top part of the
> webshop looks like this:

> Now the webshop returns to the standard view as customers see it.
>
> **Pay attention: the changes within a theme are not immediately
> visible on the webshop after saving. The new/customized theme has yet
> to be set as default theme. This is described in chapter four.**
>
> Adjust other settings in the same way. It is also possible to adjust
> parts from the Theme Configurator on the left of the screen instead of
> using the brush icons.
>
> In addition to colors, fonts and images can also be adjusted. Below is
> a screenshot for adjusting the body-font family. This is the main type
> for the webshop.
>
> <img src=".Manual theme management FloriShop\media\image21.png" style="width:5.7214in;height:2.71528in" />
>
> Body-font-family determines the default type that is used on the
> webshop. The default value for this setting is as follows:
> "florifont", "Asap", Arial. The font names in quotation marks are
> Florisoft-specific fonts. The last value, Arial in this example, is a
> commonly available font.
>
> The operation of a setting like this is as follows: the webshop tries
> to apply the value with a priority from left to right. So in the
> example above, first the "florifont" is tried. If this does not work,
> "Asap" will be tried. If that font also fails, the Arial font is
> applied.
>
> In addition to the font (type), the size of the text can also be
> changed. An example is the h4 font size.
>
> <img src=".Manual theme management FloriShop\media\image22.png" style="width:5.66087in;height:2.65115in" />
>
> The size of the text can be expressed in different units. At this
> moment pixels, percent and letter units (font units) are supported.
>
> **Pay attention: for the new text size, always use the format as
> currently stated. In the screenshot above the value is 1,438. This is
> a broken number. So use a broken number for the new value.**
