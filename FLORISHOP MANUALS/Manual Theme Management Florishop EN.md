# Florisoft User Manual: Theme Management

###    

Welcome to the FloriShop manual Theme Management. FloriShop has a wide range of possibilities with regard to the style and design of the webshop. Through an administrator account it’s possible to customize the webshop so it fits exactly with the wishes of you and your customers. This manual explains the most important style options for FloriShop, supported with illustrations.

The intention is that after, reading this manual you are able to independently style the webshop according to your own ideas.

After this introduction, chapter two describes the login process on the web shop as administrator. Only administrator users are able to change the style of the webshop.

Then in chapter three the operation of the theme management part is described. The first section of this chapter describes the steps to open the Theme Configurator. The second part of this chapter describes the steps to create a new theme.

Chapter four describes the application of the new created theme to the webshop. This is done via the webshop settings.

Beside colors, type, type size and other settings it is possible to change pictures. Changing images on the webshop can only be done by administrator users. Chapter five describes the steps necessary for changing images on the webshop.

Finally, chapter six describes some extra options available in the Theme Configurator. These are not necessary for creating a theme, but can be useful while using the Theme Configurator.

We hope you enjoy working with the webshop in combination with the Theme Configurator.

**Pay attention: images in this manual may slightly differ from what you see on your own screen.**

|**3**|It is possible to adjust settings in the customization screen and inspect them at the same to do this click on the preview button (#2).<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image</b></summary><img src=".Manual theme management Florishop/media/image444.png"></details>|
|**4**|By having entered the preview mode the screen has split in two parts: one for the settings (left) and the actual preview(right). Example shown in the image below.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image</b></summary><img src=".Manual theme management Florishop/media/image11.png"></details>|
|**5**|It is recommended to check the checkbox '*Show advanced options*' to get more customizability.|
|**6**|There are two ways to change a property value in this screen:|
|**6.a**|The first method is to select or search a property (option) on the rigth part of the screen. If you want to work on one section at a time, you can also filter based on section.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image</b></summary><img src=".Manual theme management Florishop/media/image45.png"></details>|
|**6.b**|You can also change properties in the preview screen. Parts of the screen that are adjustable will have small brush icon in them to indicate that there are settings to be modified.<br><br> Some parts will have multiple adjustable settings this will open a selection screen of the properties you may want to adjust.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image</b></summary><img src=".Manual theme management Florishop/media/image12.png"></details>|

|**12**|You may note that the changes you have made are not visible yet on the screen this is entirely normal. This is because the new/customized theme is not yet set as the default theme for the webshop.<br>Changing the default theme to our newly created theme is covered in the next chapter.|


#### Changing fonts

In addition to colors, fonts and images can also be adjusted. Below is a screenshot for adjusting the body-font family. This is the main type for the webshop.

Body-font-family determines the default type that is used on the webshop. The default value for this setting is as follows: "florifont", "Asap", Arial. The font names in quotation marks are Florisoft-specific fonts. The last value, Arial in this example, is a commonly available font.

The operation of a setting like this is as follows: the webshop tries to apply the value with a priority from left to right. So in the example above, first the "florifont" is tried. If this does not work, "Asap" will be tried. If that font also fails, the Arial font is applied.

In addition to the font (type), the size of the text can also be changed. An example is the h4 font size.

The size of the text can be expressed in different units. At this moment pixels, percent and letter units (font units) are supported.

**Pay attention: for the new text size, always use the format as currently stated. In the screenshot above the value is 1,438. This is a broken number. So use a broken number for the new value.**
